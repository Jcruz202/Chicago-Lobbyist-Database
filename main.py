# CS 341 Project 2 Part 3 â€“ Chicago Lobbyist Database App
# The goal of this project is to write a console-based database application in Python, this
# time using an N-tier design. The database used for this project consists of information
# pertaining to registered lobbyists in Chicago, their employers, their clients, and their compensation.
